Files for RHTML-MODE are licensed under the MPL Tri-license (MPL

EXCEPT for the following:
  ``rhtml-sgml-hacks.el''
  ``rhtml-font.el''
Which are licensed under the GPL License due to using GPL'ed code verbatim.

Also, since FSF Emacs (the reference elisp implementaion) is released
under the GPL it is questionable as to wether elisp which can run in
Emacs--and indeed, Emacs is the intendend target--should also fall
under the GPL.  I hold to the belief that license violations for elisp
code ONLY OCCUR DURING EXECUTION and not for "at rest" code which may
make reference to GPL'ed functions.  However, if you have any doubts
the MPL Tri-license allows you to choose the GPL.
