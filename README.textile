h1. Your Ruby and Rails Oriented Emacs dot file.

Now used with version 24.3. We're up to date, son.

h2. Highlights

* Uses built in Ruby mode.
* Uses package.el for managing packages for all the modes.
* <code>C+c C+c</code> for comment and uncomment a region.
* <code>C-S-m</code> to see magit status.
* <code>M+/</code> to autocomplete function names (type the first letters and hit M+/ and it'll autocomplete).
* <code>C+c t</code> in a ruby test file will hopefully run that test. (Experimental but works in plain ruby type testing, rails... not so much. Getting there).

h2. Installation

0. Install emacs using homebrew (chances are you are on OS X) <code>brew install emacs --HEAD --use-git-head --cocoa --srgb</code>
1. Git clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d/
2. Boot emacs

You will see your machine download packages in the minibuffer.  If you get any 'errors', especially time out errors, just reboot emacs agin. package runs at startup and will look for new packages that were added, for you in the future.

If it really borks, just <code>rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/ </code> and start again.

Keep an eye on here, as i get the urge to make things better every once in awhile.
