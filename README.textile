h1. Your Rails Oriented Emacs dot file.

Maybe it's a ruby based emacs file, whatever, screw you.

h2. Installation

We use el-get as our package manager.  That means you will boot up your emacs for the first time, install el-get with the code below and then reboot emacs. I think that's the easiest way to put it.

-1. Git clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d/
0. Boot emacs.
1. Paste this code into your *scratch* buffer:

<pre>
(url-retrieve "https://raw.github.com/dimitri/el-get/master/el-get-install.el" (lambda (s) (let (el-get-master-branch) (end-of-buffer) (eval-print-last-sexp))))
</pre>
2. With the cursor at the end of this code snippet hit C+j

3. Reboot Emacs.
You will see your machine download recipes/packages in the minibuffer.  If you get any 'errors', especially time out errors, just reboot emacs agin. el-get runs at startup and will look for recipes that were added, that it didn't have at last startup.

If it really borks, just rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/ and start again.

Keep an eye on here, as i get the urge to make things better every once in awhile.
