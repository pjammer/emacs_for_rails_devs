h1. Your Ruby and Rails Oriented Emacs dot file.

Latest version 24.4.1

h2. Highlights

* Uses built in Ruby mode.
* Uses package.el for managing packages for all the modes.
* <code>C+c C+c</code> for comment and uncomment a region.
* <code>C-S-m</code> to see magit status.
* <code>M+/</code> to autocomplete function names (type the first letters and hit M+/ and it'll autocomplete).
* <code>C+c t</code> in a ruby test file will hopefully run that test. (Experimental but works in plain ruby type testing, rails... not so much. Getting there).

h2. Installation

#0 Install emacs using homebrew (chances are you are on OS X) <code>brew install emacs --cocoa</code>
# Git clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d/
# Boot emacs

h3. Minutia

You will see your machine download packages in the minibuffer.  If you get any 'errors', especially time out errors, just reboot emacs agin. _Package_ always runs at startup and looks for any newly added packages to <code>init.el</code>.

If it really borks, just <code>rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/ </code> and start again.
