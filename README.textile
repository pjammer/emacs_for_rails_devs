h1. EMACS for Rails Devs

Just my collection of emac related 'plugins' and stuff.

h1. Installation

# "Download 23.2":http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/ and build emacs from source using these "instructions":http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS#toc11 
# git clone this repo to your home drive :
    cd ~/
    git clone git://github.com/pjammer/emacs_for_rails_devs.git
# now we'll rename the directory and move a file out into the home directory:
    mv ~/emacs_for_rails_devs/ ~/.emacs.d/
# There is no step four...

I hope, maybe not, who knows.

h2. What's inside?

Well the best stuff i could find on the web, that's what.  Nah, it's just my
attempt at making emacs more like textmate to be honest.  Many of these things are snagged
from "this blog post":http://codehunk.wordpress.com/2009/01/14/ruby-on-emacsjourney-from-textmate-to-emacs/ ,
 but I'm saving you the work of doing it.  pain in the ass
it is to learn how to setup.  This is the repo i wish existed when i first 
started this journey.
I've add too much more then what that post has.  subtle shit that you love from textmate, into emacs.
